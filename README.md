Self-Learning Project: Mantis Shrimp Shader Simulation
This repository contains the documentation and related assets for my self-learning project: developing a custom shader in Unity using Shader Graph to simulate the mantis shrimp’s unique 16-color visual perception.
Due to the large size of the Unity project, the full project files cannot be uploaded directly to this repository. Instead, the Unity project has been hosted on Google Drive and is accessible via the link provided below.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to explore the Shader Graph in Unity’s Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and implement a shader that mimics the mantis shrimp’s ability to perceive a broad spectrum of colors. The shader segments colors into 16 distinct bands, creating a stylized and biologically inspired visual effect.

Features
Color Segmentation: Implements gradient thresholds to separate colors into 16 distinct bands.
Lighting Adaptation: Adjusts dynamically to scene lighting for consistent visual effects.
Customizability: Includes parameters to fine-tune the color segmentation and brightness levels.

Shader Graph File:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uUrzVd1CV5S13AAoDMqRtGNfPts_04pb?usp=drive_link
The .shadergraph file is included in the Unity project accessible via Google Drive.

Installation Instructions
Download the Unity project from the Google Drive link.
Open the project in Unity (version 2020.3.26f1 or later).
Navigate to the Assets/mantisShrimpScene to view the scene and follow the hierarchy to check  the Shader Graph.

Reflection
This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of Shader Graph and explore procedural rendering techniques. The process was highly iterative, requiring numerous adjustments to achieve accurate color segmentation and smooth integration with dynamic lighting.
